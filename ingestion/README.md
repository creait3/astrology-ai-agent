# Ingestion  

This directory will contain scripts to ingest content from various sources such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, podcasts, websites, and books. The goal is to download content, extract text/audio transcripts, and prepare them for embedding.  

Recommended tasks:  
- Use platform APIs to fetch posts and metadata, abiding by terms of service.  
- Extract text from videos/podcasts using speech-to-text.  
- Clean and normalize text for embedding.  
- Store raw content metadata in Airtable and create embeddings with Pinecone.
